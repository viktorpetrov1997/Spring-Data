# Spring Data
## Course description
In the course, participants will explore in detail working with a modern ORM technology: Hibernate, which is practically the standard for ORM in Java applications. Hibernate allows mapping between a relational database and an object-oriented model (Java classes) using the "database first" and "code first" approaches, and provides a powerful object-oriented API for querying the database and performing CRUD operations from Java. Spring Data, on the other hand, further builds upon the standard API, offering an additional level of abstraction as well as an easy way to handle data from the database. The course will demonstrate established best practices for building the database layer of complex systems in Java applications through built-in implementations of the Repository pattern and the use of a service layer, as well as importing and exporting data in various formats (JSON and XML).
